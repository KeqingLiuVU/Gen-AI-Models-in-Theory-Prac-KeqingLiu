# ReFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding

## Overview

### Problem:

Transformer models lack inherent understanding of word order. Position encoding is crucial for providing this sequential information. Current metohds face challenges with:

1) Handling long sequences
2) Capturing relative positions effectively
3) Compatibility with efficient attention mechanisms

### Approach: 

RoFormer introduces a novel method called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE): Encodes positions using rotation matrices, incorporates relative position information directly into self-attention.

### Solution: 
1) Mathematical Formulation
2) Integration into Transformer Architecture: 
3) Experimental Validation
